/**
 * The main messaging api for communication in any form between components in the CloudNet cluster aside from sending
 * raw packets. The main difference between the raw packet api (network component based) and this api is, that this
 * network point will search the route to the target component rather than only accepting direct writes to a specific
 * target component.
 * <p>
 * The target component search is only one layer deep, meaning that you can only send a channel message to another
 * component in the network known to the handling node, or its parent component (for services). Any other communication
 * form would break the normal CloudNet cluster structure. Channel messages can get send to:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Services: in this case the handling node tries either to send the message directly to the service (if it is running
 *   on the local node) or via the parent node of the service (which must be connected!).
 *   <li>Nodes: in this case the handling node sends the channel message directly to the connected node. There is no
 *   second layer check, all nodes must be connected to all nodes (as per the CloudNet cluster contract). This means
 *   that if (for example) Node-3 is only connected to Node-2 (which is connected to Node-1), and Node-1 receives a
 *   channel message for Node-3 this will not work. This will work:
 *   <ol>
 *     <li>Node-1 gets a message for Node-2 (or the other way around).
 *     <li>Node-2 gets a message for Node-3 (or the other way around).
 *   </ol>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A channel message received by a network component should always be acknowledged by the handling participant if it is
 * a query message to prevent possible deadlocks on the sender side.
