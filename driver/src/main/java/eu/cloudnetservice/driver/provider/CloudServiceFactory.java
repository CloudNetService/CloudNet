/**
 * The main factory class to create cloud services based on a given service configuration. This factory is designed to
 * automatically run all needed checks against the given configuration and ensures that services are split in the best
 * way onto all nodes in the cluster, while respecting all settings made to the service configuration (for example if
 * the service configuration already has the node set to start the service on, the factory will think about on which
 * node it should start the service).
 * <p>
 * The taken input configurations are always cloned before being used, so there is no need to do this manually. This is
 * due to the fact, that
 * <ol>
 *   <li>there might be changes made by the system to the given configuration which should not get reflected to the
 *   later created services based on the configuration.
 *   <li>changes made to the configuration should not get reflected into the service, this might lead to unexpected
 *   behaviour of the system.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A method call to any of the create methods will always generate a different result if the service was created
 * successfully, even if the same configuration was used multiple times. You can safely assume, that a service created
 * by this factory is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> unique.
 * <p>
 * All factory methods are thread safe, calling them with the same configuration across multiple threads will not lead
 * to duplicate service results.
