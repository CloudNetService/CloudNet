 * if Node-1 is only connected to Node-2, and Node-2 is then connected to Node-3.
 * <p>
 * Note: Sometimes the documentation of methods in this class refers to the current node - that is either the current
 * component or the node component to which the current wrapped is connected (if running remotely).
