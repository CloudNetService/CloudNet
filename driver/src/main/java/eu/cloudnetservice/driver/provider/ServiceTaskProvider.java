 * lookup.

 * All tasks which are manageable via this provider are permanent. While a task a service is based on can be temporarily
 * registered in the system, this provider will <strong>never</strong> return these tasks. A service holds the same
 * configuration as a task, therefore no lookup of the task should be required. This does also mean that services could
 * be based on a task but the task was unregistered while the service is running.
