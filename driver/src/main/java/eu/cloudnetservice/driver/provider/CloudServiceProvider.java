 * The main api point for accessing and managing services running in the cluster. This provider contains some common
 * methods which are widely used by developers which are working with CloudNet. Some methods are still required to be
 * implemented by you, because they are exceeding the normal range of methods.
 * <p>
 * There are two main ways to access a service running in the cluster. You can either get a snapshot of them, which
 * represents the state of the service at a given time, or a provider which then allows you to execute further actions
 * which will directly impact the service. No methods in here are available to create services, for this purpose use
 * {@link CloudServiceFactory} instead.
