/**
 * The configuration based on which a service gets created. This configuration is completely lose from any service task
 * or group configuration and only softly includes them. This means that creating a service without having to create a
 * task first is completely possible and supported. One example use case are private servers which don't require a task
 * to be created.
 * <p>
 * Example usage to create a service based on a task:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  public final class ServiceCreateHelper {
 *    public void createService() {
 *      ServiceTask task = serviceTaskProvider.serviceTask("Lobby");
 *      ServiceConfiguration config = ServiceConfiguration.builder(task).build();
 *      ServiceCreateResult createResult = config.createNewService();
 *
 *      if (createResult.state() == ServiceCreateResult.State.CREATED) {
 *        // the service was created
 *        // prints for example "Lobby-1"
 *        System.out.println(createResult.serviceInfo().name());
 *      } else {
 *        // service creation failed or was deferred
 *        System.out.println("Unable to create service: " + createResult.state());
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Example of changing the task name of the service, this change will show up in the service name:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  public final class ServiceCreateHelper {
 *    public void createService() {
 *      ServiceTask task = serviceTaskProvider.serviceTask("Lobby");
 *      ServiceConfiguration config = ServiceConfiguration.builder(task)
 *        .taskName("HelloWorld")
 *        .build();
 *      ServiceCreateResult createResult = config.createNewService();
 *
 *      if (createResult.state() == ServiceCreateResult.State.CREATED) {
 *        // the service was created
 *        // prints for example "HelloWorld-1" because we changed the name of the task
 *        System.out.println(createResult.serviceInfo().name());
 *      } else {
 *        // service creation failed or was deferred
 *        // for example not enough heap memory was free to start the service
 *        System.out.println("Unable to create service: " + createResult.state());
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * But you can also create a service without any task, configured as we want it to be. It's required to set the task and
 * environment name to create a service that way. Example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  public final class ServiceCreateHelper {
 *    public void createService() {
 *      ServiceConfiguration config = ServiceConfiguration.builder()
 *        .nameSplitter("#")
 *        .maxHeapMemory(1024)
 *        .taskName("HelloWorld")
 *        .environment("MINECRAFT_SERVER")
 *        .build();
 *      ServiceCreateResult createResult = config.createNewService();
 *
 *      if (createResult.state() == ServiceCreateResult.State.CREATED) {
 *        // the service was created
 *        // prints for example "HelloWorld#1" because
 *        // we set the task name and name splitter to these values
 *        System.out.println(createResult.serviceInfo().name());
 *      } else {
 *        // service creation failed or was deferred
 *        // for example not enough heap memory was free to start the service
 *        System.out.println("Unable to create service: " + createResult.state());
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @since 4.0
