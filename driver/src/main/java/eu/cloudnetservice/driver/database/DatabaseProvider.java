/**
 * Represents a provider for databases. A database in CloudNet might better be known as a table (SQL) or collection
 * (MongoDB). Therefore, a database provider represents a collection of databases, also known as a Database
 * (SQL/MongoDB).
 * <p>
 * Every database must have a unique name which is case-sensitive. When retrieving a database there is no difference
 * between a database which runs externally or a database which is embedded. The creation of a new database (if
 * required) should be executed when retrieving the database object. For remote databases (retrieval while not being on
 * a node component) the create operation can be executed when the database is used for the first time. Therefore, the
 * method {@link #database(String)} should never suspend the calling thread.
 * <p>
 * Deleting a database must remove all key-value pairs which are stored in the database. There is no guarantee that a
 * database request/delete is directly visible to all components in the cluster as stated in {@link Database}.
 * <p>
 * Warning: In normal cases it is not recommended using the CloudNet database system for all of your data. The system
 * will just write the value document as a plain string into the database which might lead to problems with some
 * databases which are unable to handle such a mass of data. On the other hand it is much easier to use another
 * structure if you want to randomly access single data fields instead of always accessing the hole chunk of data stored
 * in the database.
