/**
 * Represents a database in the CloudNet. A database might be better known as a table (SQL) or collection (MongoDB).
 * CloudNet uses a database to store values mapped to a key. A key must be unique within the database but can be
 * overridden when a new value should get associated with a previously existing key. Every key is case-sensitive.
 * <p>
 * A database object can be obtained using {@link DatabaseProvider#database(String)} and should never be instantiated
 * directly (may lead to unexpected behaviour when using the database).
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, there is no guarantee that writes to a database are synced directly into the cluster. You can verify if
 * an operation will be directly visible to all nodes by calling {@link #synced()}. If the method returns false either
 * the server owner should consider changing to a solution which syncs instantly in the cluster, or you might run into
 * synchronization problems when operating on the same data from different nodes.
 * <p>
 * Warning: In normal cases it is not recommended using the CloudNet database system for all of your data. The system
 * will just write the value document as a plain string into the database which might lead to problems with some
 * databases which are unable to handle such a mass of data. On the other hand it is much easier to use another
 * structure if you want to randomly access single data fields instead of always accessing the hole chunk of data stored
 * in the database.
 * <p>
 * Note: Great care must be taken when trying to read all values or key-value pairs from a database. The operation might
 * take a while and for components which are not a node they need to get transferred over the network. Same thing
 * applied for searches based on an entry in the database. These searches are not deep, meaning that you can only search
 * reliably for top level entries in the value json rather than nested searches.
