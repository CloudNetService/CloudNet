/**
 * The root of a document tree. A document tree consists of key-value pairs, where the keys are string and values are
 * one of the following types:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Objects
 *   <li>Arrays
 *   <li>Primitives
 *   <li>Null
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A document can contain multiple sub-documents which are represented as object types. Each of these nesting levels can
 * generically be accessed by reading the document that is associated with the key rather than parsing it to a specific
 * java representation.
 * <p>
 * Due to the fact that a document is not representing a specific implementation (for example JSON) there is no
 * guarantee that an implementation supports all methods to read elements from the underlying configuration type. In
 * these cases the called methods will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}. If a conversion between different
 * document types is required, use the send api as follows:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   Document jsonDocument = Document.newJsonDocument().append("json_key", "Hello World!");
 *   Document.Mutable tomlDocument = TomlDocumentSource.newDocument().append("toml_key", "CloudNet");
 *
 *   // Serializes the content of the json document into a format that
 *   // must be supported by all implementations. This action does not
 *   // affect the source document at all (all key value pairs of the
 *   // source document are still available after the method call)
 *   DocumentSend send = jsonDocument.send();
 *
 *   // Puts in the serialized content of the source document into the
 *   // target document. If the target implementation does not support
 *   // all element types they might get ignored and are not available
 *   // in the target document. This method call will override all
 *   // existing value mappings if a duplicate key is encountered.
 *   tomlDocument.receive(send);
 *   Assertions.assertEquals("CloudNet", tomlDocument.getString("toml_key")); // old key is present
 *   Assertions.assertEquals("Hello World!", tomlDocument.getString("json_key")); // key of json document is present
 *
 *   // This way a new document is created to receive the content of the
 *   // source document rather than appending to an existing one
 *   Document newTomlDocument = TomlDocumentFactory.INSTANCE.receive(send);
 *   Assertions.assertFalse(newTomlDocument.contains("toml_key")); // this key was not send from the json document
 *   Assertions.assertEquals("Hello World!", newTomlDocument.getString("json_key")); // key of json document is present
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * There are two versions of document implementation: a mutable ({@link Mutable}) and an immutable version. The
 * immutable version has the single constraint that there are no changes made to the document after it became immutable,
 * which guarantees that reading from the same immutable document in multiple places will never result in a different
 * outcome. There is no guarantee for the mutable version of the document to be thread-safe.
 *
