/**
 * Represents a receiver of a channel message. A channel message can be sent to a variety of receiver types including:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>ALL: includes all network components which are within the network
 *   <li>NODE: includes all nodes which are within the network
 *   <li>SERVICE: includes all services which are within the network
 *   <li>TASK: includes all services of the given task
 *   <li>GROUP: includes all services which are in the given group
 *   <li>ENVIRONMENT: includes all services which are using the given environment. See {@link #environment(ServiceEnvironmentType)}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A channel message target can optionally take a name of the target. If no name is provided its interpreted as
 * &quot;all components of the given type&quot;. It is illegal to create a target with no name given for the types
 * {@link Type#TASK} and {@link Type#GROUP}. However, a creation of these types in combination with null as the
 * name is a valid operation and will not fail.
 * <p>
 * Note: Types are not overriding meaning that setting a target for all services and (for example) specifically the
 * service Abc-1 is valid and will cause the service to receive the channel message twice.
 * <p>
 * Do not extend this class to get access to it's constructors, use {@link #of(Type, String)} or for targeting a specific
 * environment {@link #environment(ServiceEnvironmentType)} instead.
