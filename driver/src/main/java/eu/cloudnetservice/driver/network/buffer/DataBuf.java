/**
 * Represents an immutable buffer which is essentially a wrapper around some kind of readable buffer. By default,
 * CloudNet wraps the netty ByteBuf meaning that read operations are deferred to an underlying byte array of nio byte
 * buffer.
 * <p>
 * However, a data buf does not allow (in comparison to other wrappers) the random access to bytes at specific positions
 * (for example using a netty ByteBuf {@code buf.getByte(index)} would be possible, but isn't in this buffer). But it
 * must be possible for a reader to store the current position of the buffer and return to it (for example after
 * reading). This is done by starting a transaction using {@link #startTransaction()}, reading or writing to the buffer
 * and restoring the previous position by using {@link #redoTransaction()}. Note: This will not remove bytes written to
 * the buffer, other write operations will however start from the original index and override the written bytes.
 * <p>
 * Other operations should work as expected on a buffer, reading should always start from the head of the buffer,
 * reflecting the operation over all other readers. If one reader reads a byte from the buffer, the next one will start
 * at the second byte in the buffer, not the first one.
 * <p>
 * Buffers are not required to be thread safe, they can but should be treated specially in these cases. Concurrent read
 * and/or write operations will therefore produce (by default) different results when spread over threads.
 * <p>
 * Buffers should avoid memory leaks by ensuring to release their content after the last byte of the buffer was read.
 * This behaviour is toggleable by using {@link #disableReleasing()} and {@link #enableReleasing()}. However, direct
 * call to the {@link #release()} method will (when releasing is disabled) get discarded silently. The same behaviour
 * applies to the buffer when used in a try-with-resources block or {@code close()} is called directly.
 * <p>
 * To prevent exceptions during reading, it's worth noting that using {@code readableBytes() > 0} it is possible to
 * verify that there are still bytes left in the buffer to read.
 * <p>
 * It is not recommended using any constructor to create an instance of a data buf - you should obtain a factory for
 * them and create your instance using the given factory methods.
