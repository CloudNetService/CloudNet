/**
 * A chainable rpc is a powerful extension to the normal rpc system which allows a developer to execute code on the
 * result of the previous method call. For example, the first rpc call might return an integer from the method {@code
 * availableDiskSpace}, you can then join on the integer of the method result and call {@code toString} directly on the
 * result of that method.
 * <p>
 * A rpc chain is completely null aware, you can call a method in the chain which returns null and the handler will
 * ensure that the result send back to the network component matches the expected method result, either returning null
 * for a null-accepting return type or the default value of a primitive type (for example an integer will be normalized
 * to 0).
 * <p>
 * Exceptions that happen on the way through the chain will get serialized and sent back to the calling network
 * component resulting in an exception on the caller site as well.
 * <p>
 * RPC chains are completely safe to re-use, every join on a rpc chain will result in a new rpc chain instance.
 *
 * @since 4.0
