/**
 * An implementation of a network task scheduler that slowly starts more threads depending on the count of tasks that
 * couldn't be scheduled into the core executor service. If more and more tasks are starting to come in and the core
 * thread pool is not able to keep up, the pace of starting new threads increases. Initially the time between thread
 * starts is 2.5 seconds, and it can go all the way down to 100ms if needed (starting at around 160 tasks waiting to be
 * scheduled).
