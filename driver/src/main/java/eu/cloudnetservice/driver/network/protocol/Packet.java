/**
 * Represents the main communication entrypoint for the CloudNet network. Every data which is sent over the network must
 * implement this class in order to indicate that. A packet contains 3 objects, 2 of them are required:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The channel id of the channel to send the packet to, for later identification. (Required)
 *   <li>The data buf, representing the content of the packet which gets transferred. (Required)
 *   <li>The query unique id for identification of the query when a network component responds. (Optional)
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A packet channel id must be unique within the network and represents the first identification point when receiving a
 * packet. Each listener for packets, registered via the packet listener registry, uses the id to identify all listeners
 * which must get called in order to process the packet. Later identification in more detail can be made by reading from
 * the content of the buffer.
 * <p>
 * The query unique id of the packet is only set in two cases, either if the packet sender expects a response from the
 * component to which the packet got sent, or if the packet is a response to a query, in which case the packet unique id
 * should be -1.
