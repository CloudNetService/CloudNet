 * Provides an interface to execute all types of operations on templates stored on any file system. A template storage
 * is bound to that file system and can not interoperate with different file systems.
 * <p>
 * All operations which are executable from a template storage are based on the assumption that you either can access
 * files using an output/input stream or via the local file system. Once a template storage was closed via the provided
 * close method it is not safe anymore to access data through it. These operations might succeed as expected but will
 * most likely fail. It is safe to access a template storage from multiple threads concurrently, but there are no checks
 * made if the template storage is still in use when the storage is getting closed, meaning that other threads which are
 * still accessing the storage might die due to an exception.
