### Storage FTP/FTPS

The module allows a TemplateStorage to connect to a remote server with either FTP or FTPS. For this, the current file
path is still required in the configuration. The structure of the templates is similar to that of the Local Template
System, except that the default storage name is "ftp". However, this can be changed in the config.json of this module.
Basically, the module needs a proper basic configuration to use it. The use of the template storage "ftp" could lead to
immediate errors without previous configuration.
