### SyncProxy

The SyncProxy module is responsible for the pure representation of the motd and the tab list in order to
synchronize proxy services within a group. She also has a maintenance mode with a whitelist on it.
Above all, it is interesting when it comes to the use of multiple proxy services to distribute the players there.

The permission, which you can join in maintenance mode
```

Motd Patterns:

```
%proxy% - The current proxy service name
%proxy_uniqueId% - The current proxy service uniqueId
%task% - the current task name of the current proxy
%node% - the node uniqueId of the proxy
```

Tablist Patterns:

```
%proxy% - The current proxy service name
