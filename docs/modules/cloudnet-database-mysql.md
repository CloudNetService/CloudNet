### Database MySQL

This module allows an alternative database system for the internal staticServices of data. MySQL and MariaDB are used as
alternative databases. In the "registry" file, you can use the database system on "mysql" or what is set in the
configuration file and restart the cloud. This module can only be loaded once at runtime. It can not be reloaded
manually except through the Node API.
