# Cloud Network Environment Technology 3 for Minecraft

![CloudNet V3 Logo](./docs/images/header.png)

## What is CloudNet?

**CloudNet** is an alternative application that can dynamically and easy deploy Minecraft oriented software. It should greatly simplify the work and the technical processes within a Minecraft server network or with standalone servers. The program should be the basis for a **Minecraft network**. With a **very extensive** API and a **very modular** architecture, the program should be easily extensible in all its capabilities. It should be a solution to the most creative ideas that brighten our Minecraft world. From minigame networks, CityBuild servers to private servers with CloudNet is the work **low**. If it needs to be developed for CloudNet, it will provide an **API** (Driver) that can be used to develop Bukkit / Sponge / Nukkit plugins or to develop modules to extend the core system. The **application wrapper** for the **JVM** allows support for a wide variety of Minecraft server software and allows direct inclusion of the API to retain it throughout the lifetime of the application.

###### **CloudNet v3** is the next generation of Minecraft Java and Bedrock cloud systems

## Minimal requirements
- Java 8 JRE (alt. 10 or 11)
- 128MB JVM Heap size
- 2GB DDR3 System memory
- 2 virtual cores
- Internet connection

## Recommended requirements
- Java 11 JRE
- 512MB JVM Heap size
- 8GB DDR3 system memory
- 2-4 virtual cores
- Internet connection

## Build

Linux / OSX
```
git clone https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet-v3.git
cd CloudNet-v3
./gradlew
```

Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet-v3.git
cd CloudNet-v3
gradlew.bat
```

## Setup

CloudNet should be started via the following script via Shell.

#### Default:

```
java -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:CompileThreshold=100 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCompressedOops -Xmx512m -Xms256m -jar launcher.jar
```

The launcher should install the application files, then the dependencies. If it is finished, it will run the application itself.
For each version, this preparation is done dynamically.
