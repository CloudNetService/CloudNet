    CloudNet's rest API version 2 is the next generation in CloudNet's rest history. It has
    definitely more opportunities than the previous version of it and provides
    a lot of methods to manage and control the CloudNet node and cluster behaviour.

    The API is based on http/https requests and mostely JSON responses. You need
    to send your session bearer token when you make a request. The token can be
    obtained by sending a request to the /auth route. Most of the routes require
    an authentication and a permission which must be set to access the endpoint.

    All the responses contain a `success` boolean (if they are JSON responses) giving
    information whether or not the request was handled successfully. If that boolean is
    `false` an extra `reason` field is appended to the JSON entity defining the cause
    of the failure.

    Every rest rout is fixed to a version number and every call must contain one.
    The latest one is 2. The latest stable endpoint base URL is
    `http(s)://{host}:{port}/api/v2/`. Host and port is the one defined in your
    CloudNet's node config.json `httpListeners` section. If you want to use https
    you have to configure the web SSL settings in the same file.
